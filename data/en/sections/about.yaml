# a summary about you
summary: 'I’m a computer network and Linux enthusiast who speaks Java, JavaScript fluently. When I’m not coding, you’ll find
me enjoying nature, practicing sustainability, or roller skating—I’ve been at it for 20 of my 25 years! I enjoy mixing
tracks as much as I love setting up servers and writing code. Outgoing, curious, and dedicated, I’m always up for a new
challenge and a good laugh.'
