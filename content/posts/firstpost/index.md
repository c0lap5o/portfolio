Greetings Web! Welcome to my portfolio.

<h1>#HIRE ME!!!!!</h1>

Hi, my name is Pedro Colaço, and I'm starting my journey as a developer, looking for a job! I'm making projects and trying to find my way through the IT world. Also, this is my first public website!

As this is my first post, I will talk a little bit about myself so you can get to know me better and understand what I'm doing regarding my career and projects.

I am a very curious person who likes to learn and solve problems; maybe that's why I love programming so much! I have been learning AWS, and actually, it's where this website is deployed (YAY!). I am also currently learning Angular, self-taught, and this website might be getting a makeover eventually.

I'm full of ideas to create things but have little time to make them. I WILL ALWAYS, BUT ALWAYS, HAVE PROJECTS ON THEIR WAY. My never-ending creativity and craving to create will keep this machine going, trying to solve real-world problems or just designing cool stuff. And yes, I say the word "stuff" a lot.

I love music and listen to various genres. One minute I might be listening to classical music, and the next, Psy Trance Hitech. Yeah, it gets wild! I absolutely love listening to music and going camping. Nature is where we are all supposed to be, and we must maintain it sustainably. Yes, it sounds kind of like an antithesis, but I like both worlds—nature and tech—and believe in harmony with nature. Besides, I love myself that way.

Since I don't want this post to get too long, I will end it here. If you want to know more about me or hire me—because yes, I am currently searching for a job—PLEASE HIRE ME! I CODE FOR TEA!!! Just keep coming here for updates; maybe a newsletter will be created—I don’t know.

Well, this is it! I will just leave here my next two project releases:

- Deploy Nextcloud with Docker Compose and Traefik
- Job search tool that gathers information from some curated websites

<h1>SERIOUSLY PLEASE HIRE ME!!!!!</h1>

<h1>Goodbye! Hope you liked this post and have a beautiful day!!!</h1>
