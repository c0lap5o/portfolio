### Job Search Reflections

Hi again everyone! ðŸŒŸ I hope youâ€™re all doing well. I'm back to share more about my job search journey and give you some insights into what's been happening.

On a personal note, the **job hunt has been a challenge**. As a junior developer without a degree, it often feels like I'm climbing an uphill battle. I've dedicated so much time to learning, building projects, and applying for jobs, but feedback from companies is hard to come by. Sometimes it feels like I'm just shouting into the void. Wouldn't it be great if companies could send a little note saying, "Hey, here's what you can work on to improve"? I know it's not realistic for every application since recruiters have hundreds or even thousands to review, but even a bit of guidance would help **so much**.

And donâ€™t even get me started on those **"junior" job postings** that ask for 3-5 years of experience along with a laundry list of skills. Seriously? Are you looking for someone fresh out of school or a coding wizard who's been living in a basement for five years? ðŸ˜‚ Letâ€™s be realâ€”either you want a junior or a mid/senior developer, and thereâ€™s no way a senior/mid developer would accept that entry-level pay.

### There are already a lot of applications like this, should I make one?
To boost my chances and keep myself motivated, I've been working on a **cloud application developed in Java**, as I mentioned in my previous [post](https://c0lap5o.dev/posts/firstpost/). During my project research, I also stumbled upon an open-source project called [Peergos](https://peergos.org/), which aligns perfectly with my vision. At first, I hesitatedâ€”was there really room for another one? But then it hit me again: the joy is in the journey! ðŸŽ‰ Even if similar solutions exist, each project is unique and Peergos resonates with my interests. Who knows? I might even contribute to it alongside my own development journey. It's exciting to see how my personal project connects with the broader developer community.

### Learning new stuff
To add a tool to my belt, I'm also planning to take the **AWS Cloud Practitioner exam**. Cloud skills are in high demand, and I'm hoping this will help my resume stand out. Plus, I've enjoyed diving into **cloud computing**. I thought to myself, "In the future, I want to deploy my applications for the world to see; why not learn something that will enable me to do just that?" That's why I embraced this new experience and enjoyed learning the basics. Although I didnâ€™t love all aspects of DevOpsâ€”like cost reduction in deployed applicationsâ€”I found it interesting and valuable for my toolkit. The key takeaway is that I didnâ€™t lose because I didnâ€™t enjoy it; instead, I won by learning that I only need the basics of DevOps to get my projects startedâ€”not the advanced skills needed to optimize costs or configure high availability with AWS resources. This knowledge will always be valuable and I'll probably revisit it later with fresh eyes, but for now, I think it's enough.

### What's that? A job offer? ðŸ˜® 
Despite all these challenges in finding a job and developing my applications, I feel incredibly rewarded after receiving an offer as a **Junior Java Middleware Developer**! This opportunity excites me deeply, and I'm determined to give my best to thank the company for providing me with this chance to showcase what I'm capable of.

### A little motivation
To all the junior developers out there facing similar hurdles: remember that you're not alone on this journey. The path can be tough and filled with obstacles, but every small step you take is progress. Keep learning, building your projects, and applying for positions that excite youâ€”even if they seem out of reach at first. Your hard work will eventually pay off. Lean on your peers for support and don't hesitate to ask questions; every bit of knowledge helps. Keep creating projects you loveâ€”even if there are already thousands of similar onesâ€”do it for the fun of it! And keep learning new things that interest you and make your life as a developer easier. Keep sending out CVs for positions that pique your interest; tweak your CV from time to time and keep throwing those ping-pong balls at the concrete wallâ€”it will eventually break!

### Wrapping up
As I wrap up this post, I want to express my gratitude for all the support I've received during this journey, especially from my brother, father, girlfriend, the CodeForAll staff, and fellow colleagues. It's been a rollercoaster ride, but every challenge has taught me something valuable. I'm excited to continue sharing my experiences and insights as I navigate this path.

Stay tuned for my next posts where I'll dive into my thoughts on **simple vs. creative CVs**. We'll explore the pros and cons of each approach that I've found relevant during my job search journey and how to decide which one might work best for you. Whether you're just starting out like me or looking to refresh your resume, I hope to provide some helpful tips!

Thanks for following along, and rememberâ€”keep pushing forward and embracing the learning process! ðŸš€

Cheers,
Me ðŸ™Œ
